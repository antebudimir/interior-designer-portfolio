                    <p class="description">First experiments with wall painting. It all began with a single peony flower at the center 
                        of one of the walls in a room. It was a pure experiment of researching the painting techniques, the properties 
                        of the paints used, which lead to a continuation on to the adjacent wall as London underground map, where the 
                        challenge was in scaling, painting thin long straight lines and adding wording. The last of the three was the 
                        magnolia tree, which was all about mixing the patel colors.</p>
